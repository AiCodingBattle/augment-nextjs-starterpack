Project Overview:

***Please write the project description and goal here***

###################

Tech Stack:

Framework: Next.js 15 (with Server-Side Rendering where applicable)
Database: Supabase (with Supabase Auth for secure user management)
UI Library: Shadcn UI (for modern, elegant, reusable components)

###################

Development Rules:

- Component Reusability: Always use reusable components to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy. Check src/components/ui for existing components before creating new ones.

***EXAMPLE YOU NEED TO ADAPT THAT RULE***
- Authentication: Implement Supabase Auth with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) sessions for all protected routes and data access.
Security: Ensure all endpoints, database queries, and user inputs are secure (e.g., use parameterized queries, validate inputs, and enforce role-based access).

###################

- UI Design:

Use Shadcn UI for a modern, elegant, and consistent design.
To install Shadcn components, run: npx shadcn@latest add <component-name> (e.g., button).
Verify if the component exists in src/components/ui before installation to avoid duplication.
- Responsiveness: Ensure all UI elements are fully responsive and mobile-friendly, tested across various screen sizes.

Additional Notes:

- Each page created should prioritize performance and user experience, using techniques like code splitting (e.g., lazy loading)

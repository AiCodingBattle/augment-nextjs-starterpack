## üìù Important: Customize Your Augment Guidelines

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before using Augment with this template, you must modify the `.augment-guidelines` file to fit your project's specific requirements.**

The `.augment-guidelines` file contains instructions that help Augment understand your project structure, coding conventions, and preferences. By default, it includes some basic guidelines, but you should customize it to:

- Define your project's specific architecture
- Set coding standards and conventions
- Specify preferred patterns and approaches
- Include any project-specific context that would help Augment provide better assistance

To modify the guidelines:

1. Open the `.augment-guidelines` file in your project root
2. Update the sections with your project-specific information
3. Save the file

Augment will use these guidelines when helping you write code for your project.

## üé® Customization

### Styling

This template uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Components

All Shadcn UI components are located in the `src/components/ui` directory. You can customize them to fit your needs.

To add a new Shadcn UI component:
